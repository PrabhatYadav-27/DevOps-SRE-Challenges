# Day 2 Challenge: Advanced S3 Bucket Metadata Manipulation


Welcome back to the DevOps SRE Daily Challenge! 🎉
Today, you’ll dive into cloud storage optimization and scripting, focusing on managing S3 bucket metadata and identifying cost-saving opportunities.

Using a provided JSON file (buckets.json), create a Python script to analyze, modify, and optimize S3 bucket metadata.



## Requirements:
Using the provided JSON file, implement the following:

1. Print a summary of each bucket: Name, region, size (in GB), and versioning status

2. Identify buckets larger than 80 GB from every region which are unused for 90+ days. 

3. Generate a cost report: total s3 buckets cost grouped by region and department. 

Highlight buckets with:</br>
Size > 50 GB: Recommend cleanup operations.</br>
Size > 100 GB and not accessed in 20+ days: Add these to a deletion queue.</br>
4. Provide a final list of buckets to delete (from the deletion queue). For archival candidates, suggest moving to Glacier.

## Why This Matters:
Cost efficiency is a cornerstone of cloud-native practices. </br>Today’s challenge will teach you how to analyze and optimize cloud resources, automate cleanup, and reduce costs—all essential for modern DevOps roles.
